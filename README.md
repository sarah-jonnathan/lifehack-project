## Introduction

"Lifehacks by Rescue Raccoons"  is a  sharing lifehack website built in collaboration as the second project for our bootcamp at  Ironhack.

## Technologies

 - JavaScript - Node.js - Express - handlebars 
 - HTML - CSS - Bootstrap
-  MongoDB

## Features

- The website has CRUD functionality, allowing users to create, read, update and delete their own lifehacks. Users can also leave comments on every post  and delete their own comments. Additionally, users can save their favorite lifehacks to display in their profile page.
- A lifehack can have an Image and/or a Video. In the case the user only wants to provide text, the application will assign a default image coming from the tags associated with the lifehack.
- A user can have admin rights, which give them the ability to add, edit, and delete every lifehack, comment, and tag in the database as well as every image and tag that is linked with it.
